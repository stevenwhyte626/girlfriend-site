        I’m so incredibly lucky to have you in my life. You bring laughter and warmth into every day we spend together though sometimes you are annoying 😂 and I feel more grateful for you with each passing moment.

        Today is all about celebrating the incredible girl you are. Your smile, your kindness, and your amazing heart make my world better every single day. I am constantly in awe of your strength, your beauty, and the love you give me.

        Love is not just a feeling, it’s a decision, and you’ve decided to love me, and I’m so grateful for that. On this day, I want you to know how much you mean to me. I look forward to all the adventures, laughter, and memories we have yet to make together.

        You are my favorite chapter, my sweetest dream, and my forever. Every day with you feels like magic, and I will never stop loving you. ❤️
